# Software Compositions by EArunga

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website, a curated collection of my software projects. It's designed to be a showcase of my work in AI, Web3, and other areas of software development.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Dynamic Project Showcase**: Displays a grid of project cards, each with a title, description, and relevant tags.
- **Live Project Links**: Each project card links directly to the live application.
- **Interactive UI**: Users can reorder the projects using up and down arrows.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout is optimized for various screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.
- **Customizable**: Project data is easily managed in a centralized `constants.ts` file.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

This project is built with a modern, efficient, and scalable tech stack:

- **[React](https://reactjs.org/)**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- **[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)**: A next-generation frontend tooling that provides a faster and leaner development experience.
- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

**Prerequisites:**

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

**Installation & Setup:**

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/software-compositions.git
    cd software-compositions
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project and add your Gemini API key:
    ```
    GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
    ```
    *Note: The `GEMINI_API_KEY` is mentioned in the original README, and while it doesn't seem to be used in the current version of the code I've reviewed, it's good practice to keep it in the setup instructions in case it's used in a different part of the application or in a future update.*

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is in use).

## üìÇ Projects Showcase

This portfolio features a diverse range of projects, including:

- **AI-powered applications** (language learning, video prompt enhancement)
- **Web3 and Blockchain solutions** (decentralized health data, land registry)

... and many more creative and experimental projects.
