## üöÄ Tech Stack

This project is built with modern frontend technologies and leverages a zero-build setup for rapid development.

- **[React](https://reactjs.org/)**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **No Build Tools**: The project uses ES Modules (ESM) and imports dependencies directly from a CDN (`esm.sh`), eliminating the need for complex build configurations like Webpack or Vite.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You need a modern web browser and a local web server to run this project effectively (to avoid potential file path issues).

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/software-compositions.git
    cd software-compositions
    ```

2.  **Serve the application:**
    Since this project has no build step, you just need to serve the `index.html` file. You can use any simple static file server. Here are a couple of popular options:

    - **Using `npx serve` (requires Node.js):**
      ```bash
      npx serve .
      ```

    - **Using Python's built-in HTTP server:**
      - If you have Python 3:
        ```bash
        python3 -m http.server
        ```
      - If you have Python 2:
        ```bash
        python -m SimpleHTTPServer
        ```

3.  **Open in your browser:**
    Navigate to the URL provided by your local server (e.g., `http://localhost:3000` or `http://localhost:8000`).
